<h1> Data Mapping in Python </h1>

Mapping exercise of a .csv file in python, in this exercise a csv file is analyzed with a list of names, regions, wines, rating and opinions about the product. 

This python script importing the json library makes a selection by region and wine, and imports to a .json file a list of these. 

It is a simple exercise to practice the specialization in data engineering in python. 



<h2> Programming language </h2>
For this exercise I have used the Jupyter programming language, which offers a simpler way of executing the code by blocks.
